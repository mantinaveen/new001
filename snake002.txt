Copperheads vary in color from reddish to golden tan. The colored bands on their bodies are typically hourglass-shaped. They have a deep facial pit between each eye and their nostril.

Copperheads are often found in forests, rocky areas, swamps, or near sources of water like rivers. Most adults are about 18â€“36 inches long. They are not usually aggressive, but will often freeze when frightened and will strike in defense if threatened, contacted or interacted with.
