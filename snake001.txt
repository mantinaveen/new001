Rattlesnakes are the largest venomous snakes in the United States, and many species live in U.S. habitats. Whether coiled or stretched out, they can quickly and accurately strike one-third or more of their body length from any position.

Rattlesnakes may use their rattles as a warning when they feel threatened, although they do not always rattle before biting. They may be found sunning themselves near logs, boulders, or open areas.
